## Project Overview
This research project presents an end-to-end data analysis pipeline for meteorological and air quality data collected at the UNAM Atmospheric Observatory in Morelia, Michoacán. The aim is to uncover meaningful patterns, validate observations, and leverage advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to contribute to air quality research.

## Key Activities
1. Data Transformation
    - Integrated multiple datasets spanning several years into a comprehensive and uniform dataset.
2. Data Validation and Cleaning
    - Employed scientific methods and domain knowledge to validate data accuracy.
    - Applied robust cleaning techniques to ensure reliable and consistent results.
3. Data Visualization
    - Designed informative and visually appealing plots to explore data distributions and temporal trends.
    - Used advanced visualization libraries to illustrate relationships between meteorological variables and air pollutants.
    - Developed dashboards for interactive exploration, enabling researchers to gain deeper insights into the data.
4. Statistical Analysis
    - Conducted descriptive statistics on critical variables identified by local research groups.
    - Performed statistical inference to test hypotheses regarding air pollutant behavior.
5. Dimensionality Reduction
    - Implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
    - Enhanced clustering accuracy and interpretability by focusing on the most relevant features.
6. Clustering
    - Applied unsupervised learning algorithms to group samples into meaningful clusters.
    - Used clustering results to generate labels for supervised learning models.
7. Predictive Modeling
    - Developed and trained traditional machine learning, ensemble learning, and deep learning models to predict cluster labels for new data samples.
    - Built neural network models for multi-variable regression to predict air quality based on meteorological variables.

## Impact
This project provides a robust framework for analyzing air quality and meteorological data, aiding researchers and policymakers in making informed decisions about environmental monitoring and management. By combining advanced statistical methods with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, it sets the groundwork for scalable and actionable insights into atmospheric science.
