## Project Overview
This research project presents a comprehensive data lake for the UNAM Network of Atmospheric Observatories (RUOA). Through courses such as descriptive and inferential statistics, multivariate analysis, data mining, and digital repositories, and in close collaboration with the International Laboratory of Environmental Electronic Devices (LAIDEA), most of the work has focused on meteorological and air quality data from Morelia, Michoacán. However, the pipelines, visualizations, and machine learning models developed are robust enough to scale to larger datasets. This project has uncovered meaningful patterns, validated key observations, and applied statistical and machine learning techniques to advance atmospheric sciences research.

## Key Activities
1. Data Extraction with Web Scraping
    - Develop web scraping pipelines to get all the datasets of ten years from any city in the RUOA efficiently.
2. Data Transformation
    - Integrated multiple datasets spanning several years into a comprehensive and uniform dataset.
3. Data Validation and Cleaning
    - Employed scientific methods and domain knowledge to validate data accuracy.
    - Applied robust cleaning techniques to ensure reliable and consistent results.
4. Data Visualization
    - Designed informative and visually appealing plots to explore data distributions and temporal trends.
    - Used advanced visualization libraries to illustrate relationships between meteorological variables and air pollutants.
    - Developed dashboards for interactive exploration, enabling researchers to gain deeper insights into the data.
5. Statistical Analysis
    - Conducted descriptive statistics on critical variables identified by local research groups.
    - Performed statistical inference to test hypotheses regarding air pollutant behavior.
    - Directed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to demonstrate common performance of atmospheric
6. Dimensionality Reduction
    - Implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
    - Enhanced clustering accuracy and interpretability by focusing on the most relevant features.
7. Clustering
    - Applied unsupervised learning algorithms to group samples into meaningful clusters.
    - Used clustering results to generate labels for supervised learning models.
8. Predictive Modeling
    - Developed and trained traditional machine learning, ensemble learning, and deep learning models to predict cluster labels for new data samples.
    - Built neural network models for multi-variable regression to predict air quality based on meteorological variables.

## Impact
This project provides a robust framework for analyzing air quality and meteorological data, aiding researchers and policymakers in making informed decisions about environmental monitoring and management. By combining advanced statistical methods with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, it sets the groundwork for scalable and actionable insights into atmospheric science.
